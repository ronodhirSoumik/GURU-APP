# GURU-APP

The main theme of this application is creating a bridge between students or guardians who are looking for good tutors and those who are seeking for tuitions. In fact, this application deals with two types of user- Guardian user(looking for tutors) and Tutor user(looking for tuitions).

Through the Tutor user, a user can create his/her "tutor" profile. Through Guardian user, a user can search for any tutor suitable for his or his children with helpful queries.

## Background
The application is fully Java-based on Android Studio. For database, I used Firebase Realtime Database.
